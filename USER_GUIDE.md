# Unplanr - User Guide

## What is Unplanr?

Unplanr helps you bulk delete Google Calendar events. Instead of clicking through events one-by-one in Google Calendar, you can select multiple events and delete them all at once.

## How to Use

1. **Visit:** [unplanr.com](https://unplanr.com)
2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. **Select** the events you want to delete (up to 100 at a time)
4. **Click** "Delete Selected"
5. **Done!** Your events are removed

## Privacy & Security

- **Minimal permissions:** We only request access to view and edit calendar events (not calendar settings or other Google data)
- **No data storage:** Your credentials and calendar data are NEVER stored on our servers
- **Secure authentication:** Uses industry-standard OAuth 2.0 and JWT tokens
- **Encrypted:** All data transfer is encrypted via HTTPS
- **Open source:** Code is publicly available on GitHub for transparency
- **Your data stays yours:** We can't see your events - everything happens between you and Google

## Limitations

- Maximum 100 events per deletion (to stay within free hosting limits)
- Only works with Google Calendar
- Requires Google account sign-in
