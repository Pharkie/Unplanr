# Unplanr

A simple, elegant web-based tool for deleting multiple Google Calendar events through an intuitive visual interface.

## The Problem

Google Calendar's native interface makes it tedious to delete multiple events - you have to click through each event individually. Unplanr solves this by providing a visual interface where you can select and delete multiple calendar events at once.

## Features

- Visual calendar interface for easy event selection
- Bulk delete multiple events at once
- Secure Google OAuth authentication
- Clean, modern UI

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React with TypeScript
- Vite (fast build tool)
- TailwindCSS (styling)

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript
- Google Calendar API integration
