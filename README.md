# Unplanr

A simple, elegant web-based tool for deleting multiple Google Calendar events through an intuitive visual interface.

## The Problem

Google Calendar's native interface makes it tedious to delete multiple events - you have to click through each event individually. Unplanr solves this by providing a visual interface where you can select and delete multiple calendar events at once.

## Features

- **Bulk Event Deletion** - Select and delete up to 100 events at once
- **Multi-Calendar Support** - Manage events across all your Google Calendars
- **Date Range Filtering** - Filter events by date with presets (7/14/30 days) or custom ranges
- **Instant Search** - Real-time search with highlighting (accent-insensitive)
- **Smart Date Picker** - Auto-sets end date to start + 2 weeks for quick filtering
- **Session Management** - Handles token expiration gracefully with friendly messaging
- **Privacy-Focused Analytics** - Umami analytics (no cookies, GDPR compliant)
- **Dark Mode** - Automatic dark/light theme following system preference
- **Mobile-First Design** - Responsive interface with sticky controls
- **Secure Google OAuth** - Minimal permissions (calendar.events only)
- **Free & Open Source** - Hosted on Vercel with transparent codebase

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React with TypeScript
- Vite (fast build tool)
- TailwindCSS (styling)

**Backend:**
- Vercel Serverless Functions
- TypeScript
- Google Calendar API integration
- JWT-based authentication
