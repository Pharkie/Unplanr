# Google OAuth Setup Guide

This is a **one-time setup** that allows ALL users to authenticate through your app.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Go to Google Cloud Console
Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/

### 2. Create a New Project
- Click "Select a project" dropdown at the top
- Click "NEW PROJECT"
- Project name: `Unplanr`
- Click "CREATE"
- Wait a moment, then select the new project

### 3. Enable Google Calendar API
- In the left sidebar: "APIs & Services" > "Library"
- Search for: `Google Calendar API`
- Click on it
- Click "ENABLE"

### 4. Configure OAuth Consent Screen
- Go to: "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
- Select: **External** (this allows anyone with a Google account to use your app)
- Click "CREATE"

**App information:**
- App name: `Unplanr`
- User support email: (your email)
- App logo: (optional - can skip)
- Application home page: `https://unplanr.vercel.app`
- Application privacy policy: `https://unplanr.vercel.app` (or skip for now)
- Application terms of service: (can skip)
- Authorized domains: `vercel.app`
- Developer contact: (your email)
- Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE"

**Scopes:**
- Click "ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES"
- Search for: `calendar.events`
- Check the box for: `.../auth/calendar.events` - "View and edit events on all your calendars"
  - **Important:** Use `calendar.events` NOT `calendar` (more restrictive = better privacy)
- Click "UPDATE"
- Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE"
- Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE" again (skip test users - not needed)
- Click "BACK TO DASHBOARD"

### 5. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
- Go to: "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
- Click: "CREATE CREDENTIALS" > "OAuth client ID"

**Configure:**
- Application type: **Web application**
- Name: `Unplanr Web Client`

**Authorized redirect URIs:**
- Click "+ ADD URI"
- Enter: `https://unplanr.vercel.app/api/auth/callback`
- Click "CREATE"

### 6. Save Your Credentials
A popup will appear with:
- **Client ID** (looks like: `123456789-abc123.apps.googleusercontent.com`)
- **Client Secret** (looks like: `GOCSPX-aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwX`)

**Copy both of these!**

### 7. Add Credentials to Vercel

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add Client ID
vercel env add GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID production
# Paste your Client ID when prompted

# Add Client Secret
vercel env add GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET production
# Paste your Client Secret when prompted
```

### 8. Redeploy
```bash
vercel --prod
```

Wait ~2 minutes for deployment to complete.

### 9. Test It!
Visit: https://unplanr.vercel.app
- Click "Sign in with Google"
- Authorize the app
- You should see your calendar events!

## When You Get Your Domain (unplanr.com)

You'll need to:
1. Add the new redirect URI in Google Console:
   - Go to: "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Edit your OAuth client
   - Add: `https://unplanr.com/api/auth/callback`

2. Update Vercel environment variables:
   ```bash
   vercel env rm GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI production
   vercel env add GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI production
   # Enter: https://unplanr.com/api/auth/callback

   vercel env rm FRONTEND_URL production
   vercel env add FRONTEND_URL production
   # Enter: https://unplanr.com
   ```

3. Redeploy:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Troubleshooting

**Error: redirect_uri_mismatch**
- The redirect URI in Google Console must EXACTLY match what's in Vercel
- Check for typos, http vs https, trailing slashes

**Error: access_denied**
- User cancelled the authorization
- Or your OAuth consent screen is not configured properly

**Error: invalid_client**
- Check that GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET are set correctly in Vercel

## Security Notes

- **Never** commit Client ID or Client Secret to git
- These credentials are stored encrypted in Vercel
- Users authorize YOUR app to access THEIR calendar
- Each user's data is isolated (they only see their own events)

## Publishing the App (Optional)

Initially, your OAuth consent screen is in "Testing" mode (100 user limit). To remove this:

1. Go to "OAuth consent screen"
2. Click "PUBLISH APP"
3. Submit for verification (Google reviews it)
4. This allows unlimited users

For a small personal project, Testing mode is fine!

**Once this is done, you're live and anyone can use your app!** ðŸŽ‰
